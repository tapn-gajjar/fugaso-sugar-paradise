All decisions are final and no correspondence will be entered into.",
	"jackpot_paytable_3": "• Jackpot values displayed in the game are delayed by up to 30 seconds. On exceptionally rare occasions, it may happen that two Jackpots are won within those 30 seconds, in which case the win of the second Jackpot is the new re-seeded Jackpot which (on very rare occasions) is smaller than the previous Jackpot won.\n• After a Jackpot win, the initial Jackpot seed amount will be equal to a 10% out of the last Jackpot win amount.\n• When one game round makes a claim for a certain Jackpot, it is locked for that game round and simultaneously assured that no other game round can claim the same Jackpot. Therefore, it is technically not possible to have two simultaneous wins of the same Jackpot.\n• If the communication between the Casino and Jackpot server fails, the game becomes unavailable. There will be no contributions or claims towards the Jackpot. The Jackpot amount remains the same until the communication is resumed.",
	"jackpot_paytable_4": "• The Progressive Jackpot amount paid out is the Progressive Jackpot value on the casino server when a Jackpot is won. Every effort is made to ensure that the Progressive Jackpot value displayed in the game is the same as the one on the casino server.\n• The Jackpot counter might be displayed in a currency other than that you are playing in. If you win a Jackpot and are playing casino games with a different currency, the amount won is converted to the currency in which you are playing and is added to your account.\n• All Jackpot Series Games by FUGASO software contains Mini, Midi and Maxi Jackpots.\nThe following contributions are made from each bet:\n    ◦ 2% of the bet is contributed to the MINI Jackpot.\n    ◦ 1.5% of the bet is contributed to the MIDI Jackpot.\n    ◦ 1% of the bet is contributed to the MAXI Jackpot.\n    ◦ The current Jackpot amount for each type of jackpot is displayed at the game.\n    ◦ The Jackpot cannot be won when PLAYING FOR FUN.",
